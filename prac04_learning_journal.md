# Prac 3 Learning Journal
<p>Week: 5 Prac 4<p/>

<p>-Learning Activities</p>
<p>Today I learnt how to use vagrant to start a database. It seems that by default it will
give you 2 wordpress databases to fiddle with. I used a lot of phpMyAdmin to look at what
was going on with the databases but didn't put anything in them,
other than a new user account. I did however set up mySQL dashboard to connect 
to my databases so I am able to change what I want without having to use a web browser
I don't know if this helps me at all with this assignment, but it is something that I enjoyed doing
</p>

<p>-Resources/Links</p>
<p>vvv.test</p>
<p> this was all done localy when using the VM to run the database for me
I will be using this in my upcoming assignment</p>

<p>-Estimated Hours</p>
<p>Because I had already gotten vagrant working I didn't have to do much
work logging into the phpMyAdmin to look at the database that I can 
use for my website. I think I spent a total of 4 hours with the database work</p>

<p>-Content Insights</p>
<p>Vagrant is fairly intuitive, there is not much to do before everything is up and running
once you have set it up you have no worries starting and running it </p>

<p>-Career/Employability/Learning Insights</p>
<p>The number of IT people who specialise in MySQL is dropping, as such
I think the ability to be able to use and interact with mySQL databases 
is invaluable in the workplace. Today I used my SQL dashboard to hook up 
to my VM's database, and will use this in the assignment that is coming up
</p>
