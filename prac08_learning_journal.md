# Prac 8 Learning Journal
<p>Week: 10 Prac 8<p/>


<p>Theory:
I have a theory that incorporating regular physical exercise into my daily routine can improve my cognitive abilities 
and, therefore, enhance my learning capacity.</p>
<p>Test:
To test this theory, I will split my daily learning routine into two parts: one group of activities performed after 
exercising, and the other group of activities performed without exercising beforehand. I will then track and compare 
my learning progress in both groups over the course of one week.</p>
<p>Learning Insights:
Through this experiment, I learned that regular exercise can indeed improve cognitive abilities and enhance learning 
capacity. On the days that I exercised before learning, I was able to focus better, retain more information, and 
complete tasks with greater productivity. This experiment also showed me that small changes to my routine can make a 
big difference in my ability to learn and retain information. Incorporating physical activity into my daily routine is 
an easy and effective way to boost my learning potential. This experiment helped me to return to the gym, as I had been
going every day of the week up until mid-April when I had to focus on work and uni for more time during the week. Even 
just 30 to 45 minutes at the gym can change the way I feel about a day in a positive way, thinking about it like that I
can understand why it impacts my learning so much.</p>
