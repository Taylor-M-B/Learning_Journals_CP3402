# Prac 7 Learning Journal
<p>Week: 9? Prac 7<p/>

<p> I have forgotten what week it even is now this semester is 
a big one.<p/>

<p>This week I learnt a little more about PHP with adding a login 
feature to an existing simple website and getting it to interact with Mysql</p>

<p>I feel this weeks prack wasn't too hard to complete
but I wish I had a little more time to fiddle around with it
and learn as much as I can, I think that it is only going to get harder 
from here if I don't research more and try new things.</p>
