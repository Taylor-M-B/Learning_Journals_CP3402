# Prac 11 Learning Journal
<p>Week: 13 Prac 11<p/>

<p>Learning activities:</p>
<p>This past week we, as a team, focused on our assignment. This included our website for TTCMA 
</p>

<p>Estimated Hours:</p>
<p>I spent about 8 hours of my own time this week on the assignment, hopping in and out of discord to help out as well as filling in the details for a2.html 
</p>
<p>Content Insights:</p>
<p>This week helped me gain some insight into careers in website development. Not only did I have the assignment with the team coming together to push through the last part of it, we all did the presentation together to finish it off. 
Reflecting on what we did in the assignment made me understand more about the design thinking process, and the team management we had to use to pull this all together. All of us were working on this project from home, so we did face some difficulties in the beginning, but that was more to do with the schedule rather than the working from home part.

<p>Career/Employability/Learning Insights:</p>
<p>I think with the employability side of things, this opened up some more options in the way of working from home. As someone in a position of people facing work, I could not have imagined doing a job from home in this way. But we managed to do it as a team and work it all out. We were able to demonstrate our work ethic, time management skills, and even or dedication to the task at hand from our own homes.
