# Prac 9 Learning Journal
<p>Week: 11 Prac 9<p/>



<p>Learning Activities: This week we learnt about using SASS and how it is a mixture of readable languages that can be 
compiled into a .css file that can than be used to run the style of your website.</p>

<p>Estimated Hours this took me about 4 hours, not because the website was hard to make or anything, but because
SASS did not want to convert to .css at first, it took me some time to get the code working to compile it into the .css 
file, but once I got that done it worked fine, and I was able to demonstrate everything I needed.
</p>

<p>Content Insights: Prep an output file, this was the tricky part about it, the output file could not be found when running
the compiler through PHPstrom, once I worked that out thought there was no worries at all.
</p>

<p>Career/Employability/Learning Insights: This same style of coding could be used to convert large a large number of file extensions
although that wasn't the point of the assignment, it did give me some ideas. This did make it easier to use .css files, 
but I don't think I would use this for our assignment, but in the business world it might come in handy when
working with css.<p/>
