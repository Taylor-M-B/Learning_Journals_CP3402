# Prac 3 Learning Journal
<p>For this prack I learnt that if you keep persisting, that at some point something 
is going to work... It took me 8 hours to get vagrant running
after testing and retesting fixes to each
error message that came up as I was installing it and getting it
running on oracle VM but once I had it up and running
I was very satisfied to have it. I guess you could say
I learnt a lot about troubleshooting vagrant. but that was not the
main thing today. What I needed to do today was
install wordpress on Digital Ocian. So I did, but 
they never sent me the password email. So I have a sample
site, and a "Home Page" site sitting there with nothing on them
I can't alter any settings without the details so I have emailed
digital ocean support asking them what is going on and I await their reply.</p>

<p>-Estimated Hours</p>
<p>I think I spent a total of 15 hours on this, between
getting it all working, and actually trying to setup wordpress
and it still doesn't work properly yet</p>

<p>-Content Insights</p>
<p> digital ocean has an easy one click install button
that allows you to install the latest wordpress build to your 
website, and attach it through IP address, unless you buy a 
domain name and go from there, but I don't think that would
work at this point, it might be local files uploaded to git hub
and hosted on digital ocean only, rather than an online version of
wordpress.</p>

<p>-Career/Employability/Learning Insights</p>
<p>After this practical I feel more confident using digital ocean and
I feel that if I was asked to use a hosting website I could
confidently jump in and have everything hosted on digital ocean if necessary
