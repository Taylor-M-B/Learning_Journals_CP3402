# Prac 2 Learning Journal

<p>Week: 3 Prac 2<p/>
<p>-Learning Activities</p>
<p>I have learnt how to make a markdown folder this week
I am pretty proud of the fact that it worked as well,
and that I am able to get it into my Git repository.
I learnt that online joomla takes a while to learn,
I still didn't learn how to upload templates to it,
I have a feeking I need Vagrent to do that, but as 
far as I know we were only using joomla for now
then we are taking it to a local build of the website
to then put it on a CMS. So for now I got used to fiddling 
with Joomla learnt how to make new pages, and how
to interact with the HTML and CSS of the website.

<p>-Estimated Hours</p>
<p>I learnt how to localy install joomla in about 
an hour. Then spent 4 hours learning how to use joomla
online for a total of 5 hours.</p>
<p>-Content Insights</p>
<p>Joomla gives you a default site to play around with,
starting with the home pade, letting you then add more pages
with strict settings with limited freedom, though with
these settings it does let you make something with 
it's entirety at the click of a button, such as the search
page I made as a test.</p>
<p>-Career/Employability/Learning Insights</p>
<p>After this practical I feel as though I need to 
get vagrent working to be able to learn more on using 
the CMS but I think that the process of learning this
as a whole will help me with employment, as I have been
focused on learning as much as I can on the subject at hand,
and even though I have had some setbacks, I have found out
what has worked for me in making these pages. Such as 
the limitations to doing the pages through the joomla website
rather than making it locally.</p>
